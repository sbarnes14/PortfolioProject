        <p>
            Hi there, I am currently a junior software developer that has recently graduated from Eleven Fifty Academy! I first found coding when taking a course for industrial maintenance, where we learned how to program PLCs.  After a few years of doing commecial maintenance, I decided it was time to return to coding.
